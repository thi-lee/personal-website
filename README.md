## Overview

### The challenge

- I struggled most with design. I was constantly concerning that my website won't look intuitive or will be hard to navigate.
- As the project grows larger with more routes and components, I need to keep files organized

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
